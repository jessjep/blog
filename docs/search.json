I am finding the FIDE chess player data to be a really great source for data exploration, so I looked at another (more traditional) way to visualise the chess federations - as opposed to my creative visualisation here.\nI wanted to do a lot more with this; specifically, I wanted to animate it by date to show the change over time. This was easy enough to achieve, however, achieving the dynamic sorting (from most to least, changing by year) of the bar charts was not so easy, and something I’ll have to play around with a little more."

Based on my experience on the Goodreads website, I was expecting to see very high ratings for fantasy and young adult books, which are quite popular. I had a lot of fun making this and learning how to webscrape with the rvest package (Goodreads’ API is no longer available). I took data only from the 50 most shelved books per the selected genres, so this may have influenced the results.\n\nI chose to separate high fantasy and “romantasy” somewhat arbitrarily based on my own opinion that they attract quite different followings. However, there may be quite a bit of overlap between the two.\nI performed a Welch’s one-way ANOVA and Games-Howell post-hoc test to determine whether significant differences existed between the genres’ average ratings (the assumption of homogeneity of variances was not met for a regular ANOVA).\nHigh fantasy was more highly rated than all other genres (except romantasy). Romantasy was more highly rated than everything except for science fiction and young adult (and high fantasy). Science fiction was more highly rated than the classics."

The following plots were created using FIDE player data and therefore only show the trend in players who have an official FIDE standard rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of chess players registered with FIDE has more than tripled since 2012. Female players coninue to make up about one in ten, a proportion that has not changed over the years.\nWhen filtering to only ‘active’ players – those who have played in a tournament in the previous 12 months – the proportion is similar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at these numbers by age group, we can see that around half of female chess players are under the age of 18, compared to around a quarter of males. This is unsurprising, and consistent with the understanding that girls tend to drop out of chess much sooner than boys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow has the number of girls participating in chess tournaments changed over the last decade? Well, there has been a small increase, but boys still outnumber them by more than three to one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended reading:\nGender Differences: The Chess Delusion\nChecking Gender Bias: Parents and Mentors Perceive Less Chess Potential in Girls"

    "text": "This week’s Tidy Tuesday used data from the {pokemon} package. I wanted to keep it quick and do something more creative - more like data art than data visualisation. Playing around with the {waffle} package, I used the radius function of geom_waffle() to create some interesting effect.\nInitially, I’d thought that the colours in the data set were specific to each pokemon, which I thought would make for a very pretty and colourful waffle plot. However, I realised that the colours were specific to type only. So I ended up grouping the colours for a slightly more informative plot.\nI tried ordering each row by various stats (e.g. hp, attack, speed) to see if any interesting trend could be gleaned by the patterns of colour, but these all appeared fairly random.

    "text": "Week 16 of Tidy Tuesday looks at data on fatal car accidents in the USA and whether more deaths occur on 20th of April (the 420 Cannabis holiday). I made a line plot showing the change in number of fatalities over time, and decided to emphasise the seasonality by adding a colour gradient to the trend line.\n\nI discovered that geom_smooth() does not support gradients, but you can get around this by manually creating the loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) using l &lt;- loess(fatalities_count ~ as.numeric(date), data = daily_accidents, span = 0.02). This can be added as a variable in the data frame using mutate(smooth = predict(l)) and then plotted as a normal geom_line() in ggplot2.\nTo change the colour of the line, I specified geom_line(aes(y = smooth, color = months, group = 1)). Having group = 1 tells ggplot2 that I only want one line with multiple colours, rather than multiple lines each with their own colour. Then, scale_color_gradientn() is used to add the colours.\nThe full code is below.\n\n\nCode\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 16)\ndaily_accidents &lt;- tuesdata$daily_accidents\ndaily_accidents_420 &lt;- tuesdata$daily_accidents_420\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nl &lt;- loess(fatalities_count ~ as.numeric(date), data = daily_accidents, span = 0.02)\n\naccidents2 &lt;- daily_accidents %&gt;%\n  mutate(smooth = predict(l),\n         months = lubridate::month(date)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date)\n\nt &lt;- \"Car Accident Fatalities in the USA: 1992–2017\"\nst &lt;- glue::glue(\"The grey line shows the daily number of fatalities, with the most deaths occuring on 3 November 2007, and the fewest on 2 February 2011.\n                 The trend is displayed as a gradient-colored line showing the seasonality of fatal car crashes.\")\ncptn &lt;- \"Created by: jessimoore.bsky.social    Source: 420 Data, Harper & Palayew (2018)\"\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(accidents2, \n             aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = fatalities_count),\n            alpha = 0.2, linetype = \"dotted\",\n            color = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y = smooth, \n                color = months,\n                group = 1), \n            linewidth = 1.5) +\n  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c(\"#90caf9\",\"#f3722c\",\"#ffc400\",\"#90be6d\", \"#90caf9\"),\n                        values = scales::rescale(c(1,3.5,6,9,12)),\n                        labels = c(\"January\", \"March\", \"June\", \"September\", \"December\"),\n                        transform = \"reverse\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"3 years\", date_minor_breaks = \"6 months\",\n               date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Fatalities\",\n       color = NULL,\n       title = t, subtitle = st, caption = cptn) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_line(linewidth = 0.15),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, \n                                          color = \"grey60\"),\n        plot.margin = margin(30,30,30,30),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -15),\n        plot.caption.position = \"plot\")"

    "text": "I was interested in plotting the proportion of male and female chess players over time. The following plots were created using FIDE player data and therefore only show the trend in players who have an official FIDE standard rating.\n\nThe number of chess players registered with FIDE has more than tripled since 2012. Female players continue to make up about one in ten, a proportion that has not changed over the years.\nWhen filtering to only ‘active’ players – those who have played in a tournament in the previous 12 months - the proportion is similar. Interestingly, the impact of COVID-19 in 2020 also becomes apparent - a sudden decrease in the number of FIDE-active players which is then spikes back in 2021 (perhaps reflecting an influx of newer players who came to the game during pandemic lockdowns, or after the success of The Queen’s Gambit Netflix series?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see proportion of active and inactive players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wondered if there might have been an increase in the number of girls competing over time - particularly in recent years. Comparing active females and males by age groups (below), we can see that around half of female chess players are under the age of 18, compared to around a quarter of males. This is unsurprising, and consistent with the understanding that girls tend to drop out of chess much sooner than boys.\n |\nBreaking this down further and looking only at active players under the age of 18, we can see that there has been a small increase in the number of girls playing (FIDE-rated) chess. However, the number of boys playing chess has also increased - and at a much faster rate - meaning that boys still outnumber girls by more than three to one.\n |\n\nRecommended reading:\nGender Differences: The Chess Delusion\nChecking Gender Bias: Parents and Mentors Perceive Less Chess Potential in Girls"
