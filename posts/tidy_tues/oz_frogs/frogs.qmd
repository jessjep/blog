This week's data is from the [FrogID dataset](https://australian.museum/blog/amri-news/frogid-dataset-6/), which I sourced and curated! The dataset contains 6 years worth of frog recordings. To meet file size requirements, I limited the Tidy Tuesday dataset to just 2023 data.

I made a relatively quick plot this week to try to bump up my efficiency. Not a lot of info can be gleaned from the tribe colours, apart from that Pelodryadidae (Treefrogs) appear to be the most common, followed by Myobatrachidae (Ground/water frogs). The seasonal and time-of-day patterns are interesting and to be expected, although I wonder how much these are influenced by when people are most likely to be outside and recording frogs.
