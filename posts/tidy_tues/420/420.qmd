Week 16 of Tidy Tuesday looks at data on fatal car accidents in the USA and whether more deaths occur on 20th of April (the 420 Cannabis holiday). I made a line plot showing the change in number of fatalities over time, and decided to emphasise the seasonality by adding a colour gradient to the trend line.

![](fatalities.png){fig-alt="Line plot showing the seasonal change in car accident fatalities in the USA from 1992 to 2017. There is a clear trend of more fatalities in the warmer months. Over the years, there was a slight reduction in fatalities from around 2007 to 2011, followed by a gradual increase back to near-1995 levels."}

I discovered that geom_smooth() does not support gradients, but you can get around this by manually creating the loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) using `l <- loess(fatalities_count ~ as.numeric(date), data = daily_accidents, span = 0.02)`. This can be added as a variable in the data frame using `mutate(smooth = predict(l))` and then plotted as a normal geom_line() in ggplot2.

To change the colour of the line, I specified `geom_line(aes(y = smooth, color = months, group = 1))`. Having `group = 1` tells ggplot2 that I only want one line with multiple colours, rather than multiple lines each with their own colour. Then, `scale_color_gradientn()` is used to add the colours.

The full code is below.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 16)
daily_accidents <- tuesdata$daily_accidents
daily_accidents_420 <- tuesdata$daily_accidents_420

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

l <- loess(fatalities_count ~ as.numeric(date), data = daily_accidents, span = 0.02)

accidents2 <- daily_accidents %>%
  mutate(smooth = predict(l),
         months = lubridate::month(date)) %>%
  arrange(date)

t <- "Car Accident Fatalities in the USA: 1992â€“2017"
st <- glue::glue("The grey line shows the daily number of fatalities, with the most deaths occuring on 3 November 2007, and the fewest on 2 February 2011.
                 The trend is displayed as a gradient-colored line showing the seasonality of fatal car crashes.")

        plot.margin = margin(30,30,30,30),
