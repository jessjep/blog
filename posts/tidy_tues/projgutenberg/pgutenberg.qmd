Tidy Tuesday week 22 - quick bar plot this week. Project Gutenberg is a free ebook library of many classic novels and works of literature. I chose to look at the authors with works in the most languages (the top 25 are shown in the plot).

I used the Wall Street Journal theme from {ggthemes} and the Manu::Kereru palette from {paletteer}. While I really love customising fonts and colours myself, it sure does save time to use some premade themes. I also used AI to help rearrange the first and surnames of the authors (i.e. from "Shakespeare, William" to "William Shakespeare"). I don't typically like to use AI as I think it interferes with learning and retaining knowledge, but sometimes it's simply faster.
